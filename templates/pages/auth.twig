            <p>For too long have we been missing an album collage generator that pulls from Spotify like Tapmusic's great last.fm collage generator.</p>
            <p>Collageify solves this.<p>
            <p>The algorithim works by pulling your most recently played songs and collating them by album, then ranking each of the albums you've been playing recently.<p>
            <p>Generate yours by giving the tool permission to see your most viewed tracks below!</p>
